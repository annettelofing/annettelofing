## Hi there 👋
## My name's Annette, it's nice to meet you

### Why Data Analytics? 
I love data analytics because it is systematic, investigative, and focuses on problem solving with multiple layers. I feel connected to the data as I naturally analyze it and search for a deeper message within the information to reveal actionable insights.
